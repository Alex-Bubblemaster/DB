1.What does the XML language represent? What is it used for?

XML stands for exensible markup language. It used to transport data regardless of the software or hardware.
It is just information wrapped in tags.
It is similar to HTML but it enjoys the lack of restriction of what the tags can contain.
This helps it be very descriptive.

3. What do namespaces represent in an XML document? What are they used for?

Namespaces help avoid conflicts by providing uniquely named elements. It is the developer who chooses what the namespace is going to be. 
It must be declared in the following syntax, using the reserved attribute 'xmlns' -> xmlns:prefix(here is the namespace)="URI".
This is the namespace name. If a URL is used, it is simply interpreted as a string, it does not contain any code.

4. Explore http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier to learn more about URI, URN and URL definitions.

URN - Uniform Resource Name - it does not necessarily have to have a specific path to access the resource.
E.g. BG personal ID number. To access the person's location, the actual address (URL) will be needed.

URI - Uniform Resource Identifier - a string of characters used to identify the name of a resource and means to access its representation over WWW.
It obides by strict rules and associated protocols.

URL - Uniform Resource Locator - allows the resource to be accessed - provides information of the resource and how to visualize it - http://..
the web address and a certain html page for example.
